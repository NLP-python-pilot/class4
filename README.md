## Overall Instructions
1. Watch the following video:
    1. Lecture 6: Recursion and Dictionaries. [[Link]](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/resources/lecture-6-recursion-and-dictionaries/)


## Python assignment

### Rules:
- Do not use classes or external packages (i.e., regex)
- Only "built-in" functions are allowed
- You cannot use the `count()` or the `pow()` functions.
- All of the questions are **mandatory!**

### Submission format:
- Submit your python code to your classroom repository
- Organise your coding by question (e.g., Q1.1.)

### 1. Creating the power function: 
Input in the form of tupple where base goes first and the exponent or power goes second.


Example:
```python
in_tupple = (3,4) # this would mean 3 raised to the power of 4 
output = 81 # output should be an integer

# Testing your function
in_tupple = (9,10)
result = 1048576
```

### 2. Modifying the power function:  
Modify your previous function so that it inputs a list and outputs another list

Example:
```python
input_list = [3, 4] # this would mean 3 raised to the power of 4 
output = [3, 81, 4] 
# output should be a list including the input [3,4] with the result in-between -> [3, 81, 4].
# base is in position 0 = 3
# exponent is in position 2 = 4
# result is in position 1 = 81

# Testing your function
in_list = [2, 3]
output = [2, 8, 3]
```

### 2. Making your power function interactive:  
You have to modify your previous function so that it does the following:
